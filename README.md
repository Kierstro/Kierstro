## Kierstro
* I’m currently working on a Simple Python Discord Bot ([Kierstro/komi](https://github.com/Kierstro/komi))
* I’m currently learning `Rust` and `C`. Mostly use it for writing random stuff for my own personal use.
* Also picked up `Python` as a 2nd language for more lighter/web related stuff and hobby projects.
